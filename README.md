# Cholera-Incidence-BASIC

A macro for visualizing and sorting trough several datasets regarding cholera incidence rate being related to water filtration availability


> **Data Caveats & Ethical Use**
>
> - Country-level cholera incidence **does not** translate to individual risk and can conceal local hotspots, especially in rural areas.  
> - Cholera is chronically under-reported; treat zero-case records with skepticism.  
> - Safe-water indicators lag incidence data, so trends are not definitive.  
> - The data could be used to  spotlight systemic infrastructure gaps, **not** to assign blame to affected communities.  
> - If you reuse this script or dataset, please preserve this warning.
